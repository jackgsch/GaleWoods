# GaleWoods

This app is one of Apple's basic tutorial apps. I chose Gale Woods Farm as my location instead of Joshua Tree for the background of the app. I also changed it to satelite view instead of traffic so it would be easier to see the cross country course. I used a picture of myself as the circular picture instead of a tree. I also moved the picture to the corner rather than having it front and center. I changed what the text read to be relavent to the location and picture.

I took what the tutorial showed me, adjusted a few really basic inputs, used different coordinates and images to make it a little more personable.
